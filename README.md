# Walk Through The Bible
This is an app that allows you to view Biblical locations on a map as you read the text. The opening view is a list of books to choose from, and selecting a book directs you to a view that allows you to swipe through each chapter of that book and plot Biblical locations on the map as you go. This is in the early development stage.
