# Walk Through The Bible
This is an app that allows you to view Biblical locations on a map as you read the text. The opening view is a list of books to choose from, and selecting a book directs you to a view that allows you to swipe through each chapter of that book and plot Biblical locations on the map as you go. This is in the early development stage.  

All books have been added, but currently locations are not displayed on the map. The map is implemented and displays a pin (somewhere in Malaysia I think) but none of the locations in the Bible are clickable yet.
